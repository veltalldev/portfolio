## **Context**
This scene takes place at a local bar. Clara cancelled her arrangement with Ethan for the night to celebrate Sophie's birthday. They talk about usual bestie things, and--naturally--Ethan comes up.

{{< story >}}

{{< scene-title 
    title="A Quiet Bar, Late Evening" 
    subtitle="A Conversation Over Drinks" 
>}}

The bar was comfortably busy, low lights flickering against glass, the faint hum of music wrapping around murmured conversations.  

Clara sat across from **Sophie**, lazily nursing her drink, while Sophie eyed her with open curiosity.  

{{< display-quote speaker="Sophie, tilting her head" >}}  
Alright. I gotta ask.  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

{{< display-quote speaker="Clara, glancing up" >}}  
Ask what?  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

Sophie waved a hand at her.  

{{< display-quote speaker="Sophie" >}}  
You. The mood. You’ve been weirdly... *chipper* lately.  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

{{< display-quote speaker="Clara, raising a brow" >}}  
Chipper?  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

{{< display-quote speaker="Sophie" >}}  
Yeah. *Chipper.* Relaxed. Glowy. Suspiciously *well-rested*.  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

Sophie gave her a slow, knowing grin.  

{{< display-quote speaker="Sophie" >}}  
So, either you found the perfect night cream, or you’ve been getting laid by someone who actually knows what they’re doing.  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

Clara rolled her eyes but couldn’t quite suppress the twitch at the corner of her lips.  

Sophie’s grin widened.  

{{< display-quote speaker="Sophie" >}}  
*Knew it.* So? Mystery guy? He that good?  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

{{< display-quote speaker="Clara, exhaling, shaking her head with a smirk" >}}  
I mean... yeah.  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

Sophie laughed.  

{{< display-quote speaker="Sophie" >}}  
Nice. What’s his deal? What, like, some gym rat? Six-pack, strong jaw, does that slow-roll-up-the-sleeves move?  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

{{< display-quote speaker="Clara, snorting" >}}  
*Absolutely not.*  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

Sophie paused, then squinted.  

{{< display-quote speaker="Sophie" >}}  
Oh, shit. Is he *ugly*?  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

{{< display-quote speaker="Clara, groaning" >}}  
No, he’s not ugly! He’s just... *normal.*  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

Sophie leaned in, grinning.  

{{< display-quote speaker="Sophie" >}}  
Ohhh. He’s one of those secretly-hot guys, huh? Like, the right lighting, the right angle, and *bam*, you see it?  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

{{< display-quote speaker="Clara, exhaling sharply" >}}  
No. He’s... look, he’s *fine*. He’s just not—he’s not the kind of guy you see across a room and immediately *need* to talk to.  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

Sophie raised an eyebrow.  

{{< display-quote speaker="Sophie" >}}  
So what makes it so good, then?  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

Clara shifted in her seat.  

{{< display-quote speaker="Clara" >}}  
It’s not about that. It’s the way he *is*. He’s *patient*. He never just—  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

She gestured vaguely.  

{{< display-quote speaker="Clara" >}}  
—you know, *forces himself to finish* or just powers through like he’s got a mission to complete.  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

Sophie stared at her.  

{{< display-quote speaker="Sophie" >}}  
Babe, *who* have you been with?  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

{{< display-quote speaker="Clara, groaning" >}}  
That’s not what I mean.  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

Sophie lifted a brow.  

{{< display-quote speaker="Sophie" >}}  
Because that sounds *tragic*.  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

{{< display-quote speaker="Clara, shaking her head" >}}  
No, it’s—okay, listen. It’s not just that he’s not selfish. It’s like... he’s never in a rush to *get* anywhere. It’s not just about finishing or even making sure I do. It’s like he actually *enjoys* the whole process—like the way he touches me, the way he slows down, it’s not just for me, it’s for *him* too.  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

Sophie tilted her head.  

{{< display-quote speaker="Sophie" >}}  
So... what, he’s just really into it?  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

Clara exhaled.  

{{< display-quote speaker="Clara" >}}  
No, it’s more than that. It’s not just *wanting* me, it’s how he wants me. It’s not some *goal*—it’s like he’s...  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

She searched for the word, then settled on:  

{{< display-quote speaker="Clara" >}}  
*Present.*  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

Sophie watched her, amused.  

{{< display-quote speaker="Sophie" >}}  
Okay, I’ll admit, that’s not the usual caveman mentality.  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

Clara huffed a soft laugh.  

{{< display-quote speaker="Clara" >}}  
Exactly.  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

Sophie studied her, considering. Then she nodded, satisfied, raising her glass.  

{{< display-quote speaker="Sophie" >}}  
Alright. Sounds like a solid guy. Good for you.  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

Clara clinked glasses with her, but something nagged at her.  

{{< scene-break >}}

{{< scene-title 
    title="He Actually Pays Attention" 
    subtitle="The Sex Is Good—But That’s Not Why" 
>}}

{{< display-quote speaker="Clara, blurting out" >}}  
He does this thing.  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

Sophie lifted a brow, intrigued.  

{{< display-quote speaker="Sophie" >}}  
Oh?  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

{{< display-quote speaker="Clara" >}}  
Not in bed, shut up.  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

Sophie grinned but gestured for her to continue.  

Clara fidgeted with the condensation on her glass.  

{{< display-quote speaker="Clara" >}}  
I was with him the other day. He got pulled into this guest speaker thing for a bunch of middle schoolers.  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

{{< display-quote speaker="Sophie, laughing" >}}  
Oh god. Was it awful?  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

{{< display-quote speaker="Clara" >}}  
No, that’s—  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

She stopped, frustrated.  

{{< display-quote speaker="Clara" >}}  
He talked about... not being able to fix everything. Used this lottery ticket analogy and just—  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

She swallowed.  

{{< display-quote speaker="Clara, voice quieter" >}}  
You know how sometimes you can tell someone’s carrying something? Like they’ve learned something the hard way?  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

Sophie’s smile faded slightly.  

{{< display-quote speaker="Sophie, watching her carefully" >}}  
Yeah?  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

{{< display-quote speaker="Clara, voice quieter" >}}  
It was like that. Just for a moment. Like he wasn’t just saying it for the kids. Like he’d been telling himself that for years.  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

Sophie studied her friend, something shifting in her expression.  

{{< display-quote speaker="Sophie" >}}  
Clara...  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

{{< display-quote speaker="Clara, laughing a touch too brightly" >}}  
Oh my god, stop. I’m not writing his biography. I just meant he’s not completely useless at human interaction.  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

{{< display-quote speaker="Sophie, smirking" >}}  
Wow. High praise. Should I plan the wedding?  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

{{< display-quote speaker="Clara, tossing a napkin at her" >}}  
Shut up. You’re the one who asked what made him good.  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

Sophie caught the napkin, but her smirk softened into something more thoughtful. She took a slow sip of her drink.  

{{< display-quote speaker="Sophie" >}}  
No, but actually... a guy who thinks that deeply about stuff? Who can talk about pain without making it about himself?  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

She tapped her glass lightly against the table.  

{{< display-quote speaker="Sophie" >}}  
That’s rare. No wonder the sex is good. He actually pays attention.  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

Clara latched onto the safer topic, grateful for the exit.  

{{< display-quote speaker="Clara" >}}  
Maybe that’s it.  
{{< /display-quote >}}  

But even as they moved on to Sophie’s dating disasters and weekend plans, something about that explanation **sat wrong** with Clara.  

Yes, Ethan was thoughtful. Yes, he paid attention.  

But that wasn’t why his **lottery ticket analogy** had made her throat tight.  

That wasn’t why watching him **hold that quiet pain so carefully** had made her chest ache.  

That wasn’t why things felt so... **right** when she was with him.  

She just didn’t know why they did.

## **Reflections**
This scene isn't particularly important, but the appearance of a neutral third party creates an opportunity and a space for Clara to stop and think about Ethan. She's usually too.. immersed in his presence that she doesn't get to think about what it all means too often.

Hang in there, Clara!
