## **Context**
Writing can sometimes feel like carving away at marble—each chip revealing something truer beneath the surface. Lately, I’ve been working on Ethan and Clara, two people caught in an arrangement that was never supposed to mean anything. But meaning has a way of creeping in when you least expect it.

This scene takes place at a Boys & Girls Club event, where Ethan, against his usual inclinations, has been roped into a Q&A with a room full of kids. Clara drops by for an entirely unrelated reason—but what she witnesses shakes something loose in her.

### **Boys & Girls Club - The Moment Clara Didn't Expect to Matter**  

Clara didn't expect much from the evening.  

She was **already out**, vaguely hungry, debating what to eat, when she spotted an AYCE place--and, **naturally, they refused to seat a party of one.**  

**Annoying.**  

So she pulled out her phone.  

**Clara:** *You busy?*  
**Ethan:** *Sort of. I'm in a thing at X school.*  
**Clara:** *What thing?*  
**Ethan:** *Guest speaker thing. Got roped into it.*  
**Clara:** *LMAO. You, giving life advice? Must be inspiring.*  
**Ethan:** *They seem entertained.*  
**Clara:** *I'm craving AYCE sushi but they won't seat me alone. You wanna eat after?*  
**Ethan:** *I won't be done for another hour or so.*  
**Clara:** *I'll just meet you there and wait. I'm nearby anyway.*  
**Ethan:** *Sure, if you want. I'm in class 7D.*  

And that was it.  

No expectation. No curiosity. Just **a practical solution to an annoying problem.**  

Except, somewhere between stepping inside and waiting for him to wrap up, she found herself **leaning against the back wall of a crowded classroom, watching him talk to a bunch of kids.**  

---

**Ethan was... good at this.**  

Clara wasn't sure what she expected. Some half-assed motivational spiel? A stiff, awkward Q&A where he dodged anything remotely personal?  

Instead, he was **relaxed. Dryly amused. Effortlessly engaging.**  

*"How much money do you make?"*  

*"Not enough."*  

The way he said it--**flat, deadpan, unbothered--**made the kids **laugh instantly.** Clara smirked despite herself.  

*"Are you married?"*  

*"Nope."*  

*"Why not?"*  

Ethan shrugged. *"Haven't found someone who can tolerate me yet."*  

Clara **tilted her head slightly at that.** **Lie.** She tolerated him just fine.  

The kids threw more at him *"What's the worst thing you've ever done?"* 

*"Agreeing to answer your questions."* each response landed **without hesitation, without effort.**  

Then came the shift.  

*"What's the hardest thing about being an adult?"*  

Ethan **paused.**  He **took his time** in silence.

It was the first time Clara had seen him actually **think** about an answer, not just tonight, but in all of the time she had known him.  

*"Sometimes, you can fix things that are broken."* His fingers tapped lightly against the desk. *"A car, a watch, even a friendship--if you're lucky."*  

A beat.  

*"But some other times, even when you do all the right things..."* He exhaled, voice quieter now. *"The world is just too large to hold in your hands."*  

That landed differently.  

A few kids frowned, trying to process it. One of them opened their mouth like they wanted to ask something, but Ethan continued.  

*"For me, I do the best I can."* A brief pause. *"Does everybody here know about lottery tickets?"*  

Scattered nods. Some kids looked confused.  

*"I studied math,"* he explained, *"and with it, I've decided that lottery tickets are a bad idea. So I don't buy them."*  

*"Ever?"* a kid interrupted.  

*"Ever."*  

*"But what if you saw the winning number yesterday and didn't buy it?"*  

The reaction was **immediate.** Groans. Laughter. **A full-body wince from one kid in the front row.**  

*"If that happened to you, would you feel bad?"* Ethan asked. *"Raise your hand."*  

Every single hand went up. A couple of kids raised both.  

Ethan nodded like he **expected that.**  

*"Yeah. Most people would."* His voice was **steady.** Unrushed. *"It's very easy to feel bad when things don't go the way you want."*  

The noise in the room **settled slightly.**  

*"But you can't fix everything."*  

A few kids lowered their hands slowly.  

*"The hardest thing about being an adult,"* Ethan said finally, *"is learning to live with that. You do the best thing you can now, so that you don't ever have to regret the past."*

Clara almost didn't catch it.

A fraction of a second after finishing his sentence, his fingers curled into a loose fist on the desk, then slowly flattened out again. Like a quiet correction. Like an unconscious slip.

Like something had almost surfaced, but he pushed it back down.

The lottery ticket analogy wasn't supposed to get to her.

It was for them. For the kids. A simple way to understand regret.

And yet--she felt it **land in her chest** like a small, unwanted weight.

*"You can't fix everything."*

Ethan said it **easily. Unshaken**. Like it was the **most obvious thing in the world**.

And yet, something about the way he said it--the **quiet finality** of it--felt different. Something about the way he powered through that moment of vulnerability felt different.

Like he wasn't just saying it to them.

Like he wasn't just saying it to himself, either.

It felt like he had said it to the abyss a million times and gotten no answer back.

Clara's breath hitched slightly.

She wasn't an emotional person. She didn't cry at movies. She didn't carry around some deep, aching past.

But for some reason--for no goddamn reason at all--her throat felt tight.

Her chest felt too full.

Like she had just been let in on something too real, too personal, too quietly devastating.

Her fingers curled slightly against her bicep.

For the first time since she met him, she felt the weight he was carrying.

And it hit her, suddenly--that weight had always been there. He just held it like it didn't matter.

The conversation moved on.

*"Do you like your job?"*  

*"Some days."*  

*"Then why do it?"*  

*"Because I need to."*  

He didn't hesitate. Didn't soften it.

*"I need the money to buy pasta and meatballs."* A few kids giggled. He glanced at a little girl in the front row, something flickering in his expression. *"And sometimes, bubble tea."*  

The girl **lit up.** Clara, inexplicably, felt herself smiling.  

*"But that's not all,"* Ethan continued, **tone smoothing into something quieter.**  

*"I do it because other people need me."*  

The room **settled.**  

*"Houses can only be built by engineers. Sick people can only be healed by doctors."* He glanced around, making sure they were still with him. *"I help make things like YouTube and TikTok work."*  

That earned a mix of reactions--**some excitement, some immediate suspicion.**  

*"Wait, you do that?"*  

*"Are you the reason I get ads?"*  

*"Can you make it so my mom can't see my screen time?"*  

Ethan, for the first time, **actually laughed.**  

*"Yes, no, and definitely no."*  

It was **easy.** Effortless.  

*"We each, in our own way,"* he said finally, *"do something to make the world a better place for ourselves, our loved ones, and everybody else to live in."*  

Simple. Nothing dramatic.  

And yet, **Clara felt it stick.**

### **Afterwards - The Walk to Dinner**  

Ethan packed up his things as the kids shuffled out, a few of them lingering to say quick goodbyes before disappearing down the hall. He slung his bag over his shoulder, stepping out of the classroom just as Clara pushed off the wall to meet him.  

He **wasn't surprised to see her.**  

*"Sorry I made you wait,"* he said, voice warm with polite concern.  

Clara should've had something sarcastic to say.

She didn't.

Instead, she exhaled slowly, then shrugged.

*"You're good at that,"* she said, voice a little steadier than she felt.  

Ethan blinked, like the words took half a second longer to register.  

It wasn't a compliment, not really. Not in the way people usually gave them. But something about the way she said it--**absent of flattery, just observant, like she had simply stated a fact--**made it land differently.  

*"At what?"* he asked.  

*"Talking to them. Answering their questions."* Clara tilted her head, eyes scanning him like she was seeing something she hadn't fully noticed before. *"You're not just saying things. You actually mean it."*  

A beat.  

Ethan exhaled through his nose, shaking his head slightly. *"What, you thought I'd just fake my way through it?"*  

Clara shrugged. She didn't know what she thought.

She only knew that something about this conversation--the whole evening, really--wasn't sitting right.

Not in a bad way. Not in a good way.

Just in **a way she couldn't shake**.

*"So."* He lightened the mood as they walked towards the exit. *"All-you-can-eat sushi, huh?"*  

Clara huffed a quiet laugh, stuffing her phone into her pocket. *"You don't have to sound so skeptical. You'll like it. They have a conveyor belt and everything!"*  

*"I can't wait. It's been a day."*  

And then--**a small, casual thing, so minor she almost didn't register it**--Ethan **opened the door first and held it without thinking.**  

Not like a **grand gesture.** Not **even something he was particularly conscious of.**  

Just **a small, thoughtless courtesy.**  

And Clara--**for some reason she didn't entirely understand--felt it.**  

**She walked through, into the night.**  

And when Ethan stepped out beside her, **something about it felt... settled.**  

Like **this was the most normal thing in the world.**

## **Reflections**
This scene wasn’t originally planned. It emerged from an attempt to drop Clara into Ethan's life in a spontaneous moment. It gives her and us a chance to peek into who he is "when the cameras are off", so to speak.

I think what I love most about this moment is that it effortlessly emerged from Ethan's character. Everything from his philosophy on life, loss, and duty to his dry, unforced sense of humor seemed to have just flowed onto the page.
