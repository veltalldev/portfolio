## Project Overview

I'm embarking on a new project to build a self-hosted photo gallery application with integrated AI image generation capabilities. This application will serve both as a portfolio project and a practical tool for personal use, focusing on providing an intuitive interface for browsing photos and generating variations using InvokeAI.

### Core Characteristics

- **Single-user application** for personal use
- **Self-hosted** with local InvokeAI integration
- **Photo gallery** with AI image generation capabilities
- **Limited scope** focused on simplicity over extensibility

The application will allow me to browse my photo collection, organize images into albums, share photos via secure URLs, and use selected images as inspiration for AI-generated variations.

## Development Philosophy

For this project, I'm following a "Right-Sized" approach to implementation:

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with the simplest viable solution that meets current requirements
2. **Resist Premature Generalization**: Avoid unnecessary abstraction and complexity
3. **Document Design Decisions**: Explicitly justify implementation complexity
4. **Reconsider When Complexity Grows**: If implementation exceeds 2x initial estimate, reassess

This philosophy was inspired by a previous experience where I over-engineered a table dependency map component, creating a 300+ line solution where a 50-line approach would have sufficed. That experience reinforced the value of building only what's needed for current requirements.

## Current Progress

So far, I've established the foundational architecture for the project:

- Database connection layer with connection pooling and error handling
- Table dependency management for database operations
- Database cleanup functionality for testing
- Test fixtures with various scopes
- Core documentation for the testing framework

## Next Steps: Test Data Management

My immediate focus is implementing a Test Data Management (TDM) system. While this might seem like a tangential concern, having robust test data utilities will dramatically accelerate development of the actual application features.

The TDM system will provide:

1. **Entity Factory System**: Create database entities with sensible defaults
2. **Data Creation Utilities**: Support for single and batch entity creation
3. **Verification Helpers**: Functions to verify database state and entity properties
4. **Integration with Test Framework**: Compatible with existing test fixtures

I've broken down this component into highly granular tasks, resulting in a comprehensive implementation plan. To give you an idea of the level of detail, here's a small excerpt of the tasks for just the BaseFactory abstract class:

```
TDM-1.1.1.1: Define `create()` method signature and docstring
TDM-1.1.1.2: Implement basic entity instantiation functionality
TDM-1.1.1.3: Add attribute setting from provided values
...
```

This level of granularity helps maintain focus and track progress effectively, especially for complex components.

## Technical Stack

The application is being built with:

- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Testing**: pytest with transaction isolation and cleanup fixtures
- **AI Integration**: InvokeAI for image generation
- **Fontend**: Flutter for mobile and web
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive markdown documentation

## Following Along

I'll be documenting the development process through a series of blog posts, sharing both victories and challenges along the way.
