### Problem Statement

Given a binary tree where each node contains an integer value (which can be positive or negative), find the maximum path sum between any two nodes in the tree.

#### Constraints:
- A path is defined as a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes has a parent-child relationship.
- The path must contain at least one node.
- A path does not need to pass through the root node.
- Each node can only appear in the path once.

#### Example:
```
    10
   /  \
  2    10
 / \     \
3   1     -25
          /  \
         3    4
```

The maximum path sum in this tree is 25 (3 → 2 → 10 → 10).

#### Expected Output
Return an integer representing the maximum path sum found in the tree.

### Observations
- We first notice that a path could have any positive length because of the existence of negative numbers
- A second observation is that a negative parent can potentially cut off any contribution from further down the trees. If the cumulative sum is negative leading up to the parent, then there's no need to continue extending the information from the children.
- At each node, we consider the existence of two different kinds of path:
  - A TO-path which terminates at the root node of the current subtree
  - A THROUGH-path which connects through the root node of the current subtree and terminates on both ends at descendent nodes
- **Only** through paths are complete in their potential, to-paths exist as an extension point for nodes further upstream, therefore their weights should not be considered final.
- This implies that the algorithm only needs to compare all through-paths (considering all of the difference cases and forms they can take) and record a global tracker for the maximum sum. All to-paths can be ignored because they will eventually become a through-path in one form or another.

### Strategy Planning
With all that considered, let's dive into sketching a plan for tackling the challenge.
- Even though paths are not guaranteed to terminate at leaf nodes, it is nevertheless sensible to begin and end a path on descendent nodes.
  - The rationale for this is simple: If at each level we obtain `max_path` information from both subtrees, we can immediately determine the through-path sum at that level.
  - On the other hand, exploring potential max sums from top-down requires some sort of greedy pruning or at least selection that neither feels intuitive for a tree problem nor justifiable.
- So we recursively request max_sum information from our children subtrees
- This request gets recursively passed down to the leaf nodes, which has no unknown children values and therefore can answer conclusively:
  - `max_to = node.value`
  - `max_through = node.value` → update **global tracker**
- Backing up one level, we now have plenty of information to work with, let's first identify the input and output we're responsible for:
  - Input:
    - Our own data `node.value`
    - left `max_to`
    - right `max_to`
  - Output: Our own `max_to`
  - {{<emphasis>}}Sanity check:{{</emphasis>}} the return information of the children matches the parent's.
- So how do we go about processing this information? One again, we recognize the need to identify the relevant paths involving our curent (sub)root node:
  - There are 2 paths terminating AT the root node, one coming from the left subtree and one coming from the right subtree. The bottom part of each is already the maximum path from that point downward, we just need to maintain optimality at our level.
  - There is one path going through the root node, which yet does not exist. We need to produce this path and record it against the maximum tracker.
  - Then we report the superior to-path terminating at our root node to our parent, and the process continue in someone else's domain.

### Implementation

First let's outline the overall plan.
```dart
int findMaxPathLength(TreeNode<int> root) {
  int globalMax = root.value; // using closure to maintain a "local" global variable

  int _findMaxPathLengthUpTo(TreeNode root) {
    // base case
    // update global tracker and return root.value

    // recurse for information then post-process
    int leftMax;
    int rightMax;
    
    // build through-path
    int maxPathThroughNode;

    // use through-path to update global tracker
    globalMax = max(globalMax, maxPathThroughNode);

    // determine superior to-path to return upstream for extension
    int maxPathToRoot = max(leftMax, rightMax);
    return maxPathToRoot;
  }

  _findMaxPathLengthUpTo(root);
  return globalMax;
}
```

With some cleanup, we get the finalized version.
```dart
import 'dart:math';

int findMaxPathLength(TreeNode<int> root) {
  int globalMax = root.value;

  int _findMaxPathLengthUpTo(TreeNode<int>? node) {
    if (node == null) return 0;

    // Get max path sum from left and right subtrees
    // Using max with 0 handles negative values correctly
    int leftMax = max(0, _findMaxPathLengthUpTo(node.left));
    int rightMax = max(0, _findMaxPathLengthUpTo(node.right));

    // Update global max with the path through this node
    int maxPathThroughNode = leftMax + node.value + rightMax;
    globalMax = max(globalMax, maxPathThroughNode);

    // Return max path ending at this node (for possible extension upward)
    return max(leftMax, rightMax) + node.value;
  }

  _findMaxPathLengthUpTo(root);
  return globalMax;
}

class TreeNode<T> {
  T value;
  TreeNode<T>? left = null;
  TreeNode<T>? right = null;
  TreeNode(this.value, [this.left, this.right]);

  bool isLeaf() => left == null && right == null;
}
```
