### Problem Statement
{{% problem %}}
You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

Merge `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should be stored inside the array `nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.

Example:
```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
```

### Observations
- The merging aspect of the problem is trivial; it's merely the merging step in merge sort:
  - Compare representative values
  - Choose appropriate one
  - Advance pointer on the chosen side
  - Repeat
- The in-place condition is more interesting, because we are thus not allowed to overwrite any existing values lest we lost them.
- Proposal: Merge from the less sensitive side (right side) so that data overwrite doesn't have to happen

### Solution Strategy
1. Identify pointers at the "logical ends" of both arrays
2. Compare values, select the larger one.
3. Write larger value to write position: physical end of `nums1`
4. Move pointer on the chosen side leftward by 1 position.
5. Repeat 1-4 until either or both pointers reach position 0.
6. Write the remaining data from `nums2` if they exist to the remaining write positions in `nums1`. If `nums2` are out of data, `nums1` values are already in correct places.

### Implementation Details

First let's tackle the management of the three pointers.

```dart
void mergeSortedArrays(List<int> nums1, int n1, List<int> nums2, int n2) {
  int readPtr1 = n1 - 1;
  int readPtr2 = n2 - 1;
  int writePtr = n1 + n2 - 1;

  while (true) {
    if (nums1[readPtr1] > nums2[readPtr2]) {
      nums1[writePtr] = nums1[readPtr1];
      readPtr1--;
    } else {
      nums1[writePtr] = nums2[readPtr2];
      readPtr2--;
    }
    writePtr--;
  }
}
```

Now let's think about the loop conditions. How many problematic situations do we expect this operation to run into?
- `readPtr1` is -1
- `readPtr2` is -1
- `writePtr` is -1

Fortunately, `writePtr` will never become problematic before either of the other two, so we only really need to keep careful track of those. We can handle each case separately for readability like so:
```dart
if (readPtr1 == -1) {
  while (readPtr2 >= 0) {
    nums1[writePtr--] = nums2[readPtr2--];
  }
}
if (readPtr2 == -1) {
  // we're done, no more work to do
}
```

### Testing

Let's add a few more test cases and write a simple test fixture.

```dart
void test(List<int> nums1, int n1, List<int> nums2, n2, List<int> expected) {
  mergeSortedArrays(nums1, n1, nums2, n2);
  assert(listEquals(nums1, expected));
}

bool listEquals(List<int> list1, List<int> list2) {
  bool listEqual = list1.length == list2.length;
  for (var i = 0; i < list1.length; i++) {
    if (list1[i] != list2[i]) {
      listEqual = false;
      break;
    }
  }
  return listEqual;
}

void main() {
  test([1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0], 3, [2, 5, 6], 3, [1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 6]);
  test([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 5, [], 0, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
  test([0, 0, 0], 0, [1, 2, 3], 3, [1, 2, 3]);
  test([2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0], 3, [2, 2, 2], 3, [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]);
  test([1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0], 3, [4, 5, 6], 3, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]);
  test([4, 5, 6, 0, 0, 0], 3, [1, 2, 3], 3, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]);
  test([1, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0], 3, [2, 4, 6], 3, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]);
  test([1, 0], 1, [2], 1, [1, 2]);
  test([-100, 0, 100, 0, 0, 0], 3, [-1000, 1000, 10000], 3, [-1000, -100, 0, 100, 1000, 10000]);
  test([-3, -2, -1, 0, 0, 0], 3, [-6, -5, -4], 3, [-6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1]);

  print("All tests passed");
}
```

{{< notice >}}
The limitation of these tests (and the entire problem overall) is that `nums1` has to have
exactly the correct sizes for the testing to work, since the concept of "equal lists" includes size considerations. Consider this simple test case:
```dart
test([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 5, [], 0, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
```
`nums1` has to have no extra room after value `5` so that the comparison at the end could pass correctly.
