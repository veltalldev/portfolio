### Problem Statement

Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return `null`.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to (0-indexed). It is `-1` if there is no cycle. Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter.

**Do not modify** the linked list.

**Example 1:**
- Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
- Output: Node at index 1 (the node with value 2)
- Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

**Example 2:**
- Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
- Output: Node at index 0 (the node with value 1)
- Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.

**Example 3:**
- Input: head = [1], pos = -1
- Output: null
- Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 10^4]
- -10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5
- `pos` is `-1` or a valid index in the linked-list.

**Follow up:** Can you solve it using O(1) extra space?

### Observations
- We first notice that the values given are not of any real importance. The goal is to identify the node where the loop occurs, as specified by `pos`.
- The challenge is thus to construct a linked list object that correctly has a loop at `pos`, then use the *tortoise and hare* algorithm to find the node reference we want.
- Let's first work on the list generation helper:

```dart
class LinkNode<T> {
  final T _value;
  LinkNode? next = null;
  LinkNode(this._value, [this.next]);

  T get value => _value;
}

LinkNode? buildLinkList(List<int> values, int pos) {
  if (values.isEmpty) return null;
  final head = LinkNode(values[0]);
  LinkNode current = head;
  LinkNode? loopPos = null;
  for (var i = 1; i < values.length; i++) {
    current.next = LinkNode(values[i]);
    if (pos == i - 1) {
      loopPos = current;  // keep a note of the loop position for connection
    }
    current = current.next!;
  }
  // make connection then return
  if (pos == values.length - 1) current.next = current;
  if (pos > -1) current.next = loopPos;
  return head;
}
```

Next, let us discuss the two major milestones in this algorithm.

### Solution Strategy

#### Cycle Detection

Suppose we set two pointers, `fast` and `slow` on the head node and let them run. The list has N nodes, so the slow pointer has to travel N-1 steps to get to the tail. In that same time, the fast pointer (intentionally) travels 2(N-1) steps or 2N - 2. If we let them both take one more steps, they will each land at locations:
- N
- 2N

Location N is naturally the position "next" over from the last position (N-1), so it's either null, or it is the loop position.
Location 2N could be anywhere, because the loop position is k steps from the head, the 2N position would have traversed the loop 2N/(N-k) times, so the remainder would indicate its position in the loop. And since k is arbitrary (we're looking for it), position 2N could be anywhere inside the loop.

Since both our pointers at this point have traveled beyond the tail end, it is conclusive that a loop must exist somewhere. We also know that the slow pointer is currently pointing at the loop location, so our job is done.

However, this is kind of a cheat. Let me explain.

We're not supposed to know how many nodes there are in the list for the real tortoise and hare algorithm, the fact that we do is simply because of the limitation of having to actually construct the list to test against. So in the spirit of the problem, not the letter of it, we are supposed to solve this problem without using N. So let's back up and reconsider this "mysterious" linked list that we know nothing about.

We still have 2 pointers. We cannot make any definitive statements about when they will meet in the presence of a loop, but we can probably provide an upper bound thanks to the mathematical properties we can exploit.

Suppose the loop is of length L, that is to say, there are L nodes indexed 0, 1, 2, ..., L-1 and the `L-1` node points back to the `0` node.

Suppose both pointers have entered the loop and have yet to meet each other. At any given time, they have a distance of D between them, where D is defined as the number of steps the fast pointer needs to take to catch up to the slow pointer's position. After the fast pointer traverses the distance of D, the slow pointer will have traversed a distance of D/2, then once again by D/4, D/8, etc. until such a moment when the fast pointer makes a jump of size 2 and the slow pointer makes a jump of size 1 and one of three scenarios happen:
1. They meet
2. The fast pointer is exactly one position behind the slow pointer
3. The fast pointer is exactly one position ahead of the slow pointer

All 3 of these cases are actually all the same case:
- If fast is behind, then after one more jump they will both land at the same location.
- If fast is ahead, then they were on the same spot before that jump.

So the maximum distance the fast pointer has to travel to get to the slow pointer is the geometric series: D + D/2 + D/4 + D/8 + ... + 2 = 2D. And since D is upperbounded by the size of the loop, the maximum steps the pointers have to take before meeting is 2L.

Now, that doesn't really tell us how long we should wait before expecting them to converge because we have 0 contexts about these linked lists (particularly how long they are), but some arbitrarily large number should suffice for the purposes of this exercise.

The key problem here, however, is to take the next step and determine the location of the start of the loop.

#### Cycle Start Detection

Let's name these distances and see if we can come up with some mathematical properties.

At the moment of meeting, the slow pointer has traveled:
- An unknown distance of `x` from the head to the loop start
- An unknown distance of `y` from the loop start to its current location
- And for completeness, there is a third unknown distance `z`: the number of steps from current location to loop start. In other words, `y + z` = loop length L (i.e. number of nodes inclusive in the loop). This is an important value, because it effectively cancels to 0 for our considerations.
- In other other words, there are 3 ways to reach the loop start:
  - walk `x` from the head,
  - walk `-y` from the meeting location, or
  - walk `z` from meeting location

Let's now try to examine the meeting location to see if it has any convenient properties. We know that by now, the slow pointer has traveled a distance of `x + y` steps, thus the fast pointer has traveled a distance of `2(x+y)` steps. Because it's faster, the fast pointer may have completed the cycle any number of times, we can represent this distance as `x + y + c(y+z)`.

This means `2(x + y) == x + y + c(y+z)`, giving us an interesting equation to explore:
$$
x + y = c(y + z)
$$
Since x and z are our numbers of interest, let's solve for both to see if any relationships emerge.
$$\begin{equation}
x = c(y + z) - y
\end{equation}$$
$$\begin{equation}
z = (x + y - cy) / c
\end{equation}$$

Nothing too promising with equation `(2)`, so let's try to analyze what's going on with `x`.

Equation `(1)` is saying that traveling the distance `x` has the same effect as traveling some cycles of the loop, then backtracking by `y`. But traveling forward by `x` from the head leads to the loop start, and so does backtracking by `y` from the meeting point. So does this mean that we should expect convergence again if we:
- let the pointers meet
- set one to the head, keep the other at the meeting position
- walk them towards each other by x positions for the first and y position for the other

? Mathematically, it does sound like that's what it's saying. But we can't walk backwards because in reality we only have access to `next` pointers, unfortunately, so let's see if we can transform that equation to relate x to z instead so that both our pointers can walk forward.

$$\begin{aligned}
x &= c(y + z) - y \\\
x &= c(y + z) - (y + z) + z \\\
x &= (c - 1)(y+z) + z
\end{aligned}$$


Excellent. This is saying that the distance to get from the meeting place to the loop start is the same as the distance from the head to the loop start.

Our strategy is now straightforward. Let's implement it step by step.

### Solution Implementation

#### Rendezvouz Setup

```dart
bool detectCycle(LinkNode? head) {
  if (head == null || head.next == null) return false;

  LinkNode? slow = head;
  LinkNode? fast = head;
  bool hasCycle = false;

  while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
    slow = slow!.next;
    fast = fast.next!.next;

    if (slow == fast) {
      hasCycle = true;
      break;
    }
  }

  // default exit condition is finding a null tail
  return hasCycle;
}
```

This is simple enough, so let's move onto extending it for phase 2.

#### Loop Start Detection

We only have to modify the return type, return statements, and add the final walk.

```dart
LinkNode? detectCycleStart(LinkNode? head) {
  if (head == null || head.next == null) return null;

  LinkNode? slow = head;
  LinkNode? fast = head;
  bool hasCycle = false;

  while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
    slow = slow!.next;
    fast = fast.next!.next;

    if (slow == fast) {
      hasCycle = true;
      break;
    }
  }

  // default exit condition is finding a null tail
  if (!hasCycle) return null;

  // else, we find it
  slow = head;
  while (slow != fast) {
    // walk both forward, one step at a time
    slow = slow!.next; // will cover distancce `x`
    fast = fast!.next; // will cover distance `z`
  }

  return slow;
}
```

### Testing

Let's run the implementation through the given test cases, which happen to provide good coverage of edge cases.
```dart
void testCycleDetection() {
  // Test case 1: [3,2,0,-4] with pos=1
  var list1 = buildLinkList([3, 2, 0, -4], 1);
  var result1 = detectCycleStart(list1);
  print("Test 1: ${result1?.value == 2 ? 'PASS' : 'FAIL'}");

  // Test case 2: [1,2] with pos=0
  var list2 = buildLinkList([1, 2], 0);
  var result2 = detectCycleStart(list2);
  print("Test 2: ${result2?.value == 1 ? 'PASS' : 'FAIL'}");

  // Test case 3: [1] with pos=-1 (no cycle)
  var list3 = buildLinkList([1], -1);
  var result3 = detectCycleStart(list3);
  print("Test 3: ${result3 == null ? 'PASS' : 'FAIL'}");

  // Test case 4: Empty list
  var list4 = buildLinkList([], -1);
  var result4 = detectCycleStart(list4);
  print("Test 4: ${result4 == null ? 'PASS' : 'FAIL'}");
}
```
```
Test 1: PASS
Test 2: PASS
Test 3: PASS
Test 4: PASS

Exited.
