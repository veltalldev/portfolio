## Problem Statement: Number of Islands

Given an m x n 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

### Example 1:
```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

### Constraints:
- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 300
- grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'

## Observations
- The problem seems like the classic exploration problem that can be solved with either BFS or DFS. I prefer the queue-based BFS solution for this problem, so I'll proceed with that.
- There is no stipulation with regards to "lakes" inside islands, but for the purposes of this problem, that makes zero difference. It's simply worth bringing up because it's a significant and non-obvious edge case for this type of setup.

## Solution Strategy
We employ the familiar search, explore and count strategy.
- Iterate through each cell of the grid, skipping water cells
- When land is found, increment counter and begin "crawling" exploration, processed cells are marked as 0. This exploration consumes the entire island, ensuring its contribution to the count stays at 1.
- When land is done being explored, exit to outer loop to continue scanning the grid
- Return final count once grid is processed

## Implementation Details

Since most of the structure here resembles that of the [Count Island Perimeter problem](), I will reuse most of the code.

```dart
int countIslands(List<List<int>> grid) {
  // some edge cases
  if (grid.isEmpty) return 0;

  // setup
  int islandCount = 0;
  final geo = padGridWithWater(grid);

  // main loop to find land
  for (var i = 1; i < geo.length; i++) {
    for (var j = 1; j < geo[0].length; j++) {
      if (geo[i][j] == 1) {
        islandCount++;
        // BFS intialization
        processIsland(i, j, geo);
      }
    }
  }
  return islandCount;
}

void processIsland(int i, int j, List<List<int>> grid) {
  final queue = Queue();
  queue.add((i, j));
  grid[i][j] = 0;
  // main loop
  while (queue.isNotEmpty) {
    final (a, b) = queue.removeFirst();
    final neighbors = [(a + 1, b), (a - 1, b), (a, b + 1), (a, b - 1)];
    // each neighbor is either water or land, process accordingly
    for (var (x, y) in neighbors) {
      if (grid[x][y] == 1) {
        queue.add((x, y));
        grid[x][y] = 0;
      }
    }
  }
}

padGridWithWater(List<List<int>> grid) {
  final m = grid[0].length;
  return <List<int>>[
    List.filled(m + 2, 0),
    for (var row in grid) [0, ...row, 0],
    List.filled(m + 2, 0),
  ];
}
```

Notable changes:
- Complete outter double loop to find every potential island
- Increment count as soon as land is found, the BFS goal is to "consume" the entire island to avoid double-counting
- I extracted the BFS routine to avoid deep nesting in the main solution routine

## Testing Suite

```dart
// Helper for running tests
void runTest(String testName, List<List<int>> grid, int expected) {
  final actual = countIslands(grid);
  if (actual != expected) {
    throw Exception(
      'Test "$testName" failed: expected $expected but got $actual',
    );
  }
  print('Test "$testName" passed!');
}

void main() {
  // Test case 1: Single island
  runTest('Single island', [
    [1, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 1],
  ], 1);

  // Test case 2: No islands
  runTest('No islands', [
    [0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0],
  ], 0);

  // Test case 3: Multiple separate islands
  runTest('Multiple separate islands', [
    [1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 1],
  ], 3);

  // Test case 4: Diagonal islands (diagonals don't connect)
  runTest('Diagonal islands', [
    [1, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 1],
  ], 4);

  // Test case 5: Complex island shapes
  runTest('Complex island shapes', [
    [1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 1, 1, 1],
  ], 2);

  // Test case 6: Single row
  runTest('Single row', [
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
  ], 3);

  // Test case 7: Single column
  runTest('Single column', [
    [1],
    [0],
    [1],
    [0],
    [1],
  ], 3);

  // Test case 8: Island with hole
  runTest('Island with hole', [
    [1, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 1],
  ], 1);

  // Test case 9: Empty grid
  runTest('Empty grid', [], 0);

  // Test case 10: Larger grid with multiple islands
  runTest('Larger grid with multiple islands', [
    [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
  ], 4);

  print('All tests passed!');
}
```

## Extension Exploration

I couldn't help but notice that there isn't a high-level structured way to traverse and process the 2D grid like there are for other data structures, so I figured I'd spend some time creating an extension for it in Dart. At the very least it'll make this code more readable and help with my future interviews.

```dart
extension GridExtension<T> on List<List<T>> {
  /// Iterates through each cell in the grid with its coordinates
  void forEachCoordinate(void Function(int x, int y, T value) callback) {
    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < this[i].length; j++) {
        callback(i, j, this[i][j]);
      }
    }
  }
  
  /// Returns the number of rows in the grid
  int get rows => length;
  
  /// Returns the number of columns in the grid (assumes uniform width)
  int get columns => isEmpty ? 0 : this[0].length;
  
  /// Checks if coordinates are within the grid boundaries
  bool isValidCoordinate(int x, int y) {
    return x >= 0 && x < rows && y >= 0 && y < columns;
  }
  
  /// Gets a list of valid adjacent coordinates (up, right, down, left)
  List<(int, int)> getAdjacentCoordinates(int x, int y) {
    final directions = [(-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1)]; // up, right, down, left
    return directions
        .map((dir) => (x + dir.$1, y + dir.$2))
        .where((coord) => isValidCoordinate(coord.$1, coord.$2))
        .toList();
  }
  
  /// Gets a list of all coordinates in the grid as (x,y) pairs
  List<(int, int)> get allCoordinates {
    List<(int, int)> coords = [];
    for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < columns; j++) {
        coords.add((i, j));
      }
    }
    return coords;
  }
  
  /// Maps each grid cell to a new value based on a transform function
  List<List<R>> mapGrid<R>(R Function(int x, int y, T value) transform) {
    return List.generate(rows, (i) => 
      List.generate(columns, (j) => transform(i, j, this[i][j]))
    );
  }
}
```

With these extensions, the original solution (and other algorithms) is now much more expressive:
```dart
int countIslands(List<List<int>> grid) {
  // some edge cases
  if (grid.isEmpty) return 0;

  // setup
  int islandCount = 0;

  // main loop to find land
  grid.forEachCoordinate((x, y, value) {
    if (grid[x][y] == 1) {
      islandCount++;
      processIsland(x, y, grid); // dfs process
    }
  });
  return islandCount;
}

void processIsland(int x, int y, List<List<int>> grid) {
  if (!grid.isValidCoordinate(x, y) || grid[x][y] == 0) {
    return;
  }
  grid[x][y] = 0;
  for (var (nx, ny) in grid.getAdjacentCoordinates(x, y)) {
    processIsland(nx, ny, grid);
  }
}
```
