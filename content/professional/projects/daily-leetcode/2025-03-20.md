## Problem Statement

You are given a 2D grid `grid` where:
- `1` represents a patch of land
- `0` represents a patch of water

The grid cells are connected horizontally and vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).

The island doesn't have "lakes", meaning the water inside isn't connected to the water around the island. One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, with width and height not exceeding 100.

Determine the perimeter of the island.

### Example

```
Input: grid = [[0,1,0,0],
               [1,1,1,0],
               [0,1,0,0],
               [1,1,0,0]]
Output: 16
```

In the example, the perimeter is 16 because the island has 16 edges that border water or the boundary of the grid.

### Constraints

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- `grid[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.
- There is exactly one island in `grid`.

## Observations
A lot of the edge cases have already been kindly ruled out by the problem statement's strict formulation. We mostly just need to focus on a simple task:
- Loop through the grid to find the singular island
- Perform BFS exploration of it while accumulating perimeter count
  - perimeter contribution of each patch of land is defined as the number of its 4 edges that faces water or the boundary
- Once the BFS queue is empty, we can safely return in this specific case only

Note: One convenient pre-processing step to simplify the logic is to pad all 4 sides of the grid with water rows and columns. This way we only ever have to test for water-adjacency.

## Implementation Details

The solution is relatively simple so I'll jump straight to it this time.

```dart
int countPerimeterOfIsland(List<List<int>> grid) {
  // some edge cases
  if (grid.isEmpty) return 0;

  // setup
  int perimeter = 0;
  final geo = padGridWithWater(grid);

  // main loop to find land
  for (var i = 1; i < geo.length; i++) {
    for (var j = 1; j < geo[0].length; j++) {
      if (geo[i][j] == 1) {
        // BFS intialization
        final queue = Queue();
        queue.add((i, j));
        // main loop
        while (queue.isNotEmpty) {
          final (a, b) = queue.removeFirst();
          final neighbors = [(a + 1, b), (a - 1, b), (a, b + 1), (a, b - 1)];
          // each neighbor is either water or land, process accordingly
          for (var (x, y) in neighbors) {
            if (geo[x][y] == 0) {
              perimeter++;
            }
            if (geo[x][y] == 1) {
              queue.add((x, y));
            }
          }
          geo[a][b] = 2; // update current cell
        }
        break; // optional short circuit
      }
    }
  }

  return perimeter;
}

padGridWithWater(List<List<int>> grid) {
  if(grid.isEmpty) return [[]];
  
  final m = grid[0].length;
  return <List<int>>[
    List.filled(m + 2, 0),
    for (var row in grid) [0, ...row, 0],
    List.filled(m + 2, 0),
  ];
}
```

## Testing Suite

```dart
// Helper for running tests
void runTest(String testName, List<List<int>> grid, int expected) {
  final actual = countPerimeterOfIsland(grid);
  if (actual != expected) {
    throw Exception('Test "$testName" failed: expected $expected but got $actual');
  }
  print('Test "$testName" passed!');
}
