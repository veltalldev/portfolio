## Problem Statement

`reduce` (also known as `fold`) is a function that takes in an array, a combining function, and an initial value and builds up a result by calling the combining function on each element of the array, left to right. For example, we can write `sum()` in terms of `reduce`:

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def sum(lst):
    return reduce(lst, add, 0)
```

This should call `add` on the initial value with the first element of the array, and then the result of that with the second element of the array, and so on until we reach the end, when we return the sum of the array.

Implement your own version of `reduce`.

## Observations

There are several important considerations that I was able to uncover during my verbal examination of the problem:
- {{< emphasis >}}**Ordering of Parameters**{{< /emphasis >}}: When the `transform` function is non-commutative, the ordering of the parameters matter. We can either expect more information from the perspective of the `reduce` function, or we can adopt a sensible default of `accumulator` first and create reasonable expectations for the outside world.
- {{< emphasis >}}**Unknown Data Type**{{< /emphasis >}}: We don't know what kind of data we're working with. The combination logic is defined by the `transform` function that we receive and invoke; it's essentially a black box. Given that constraint, we are not able to duplicate the value and return it independently. The only sensible operation is to update the reference to the `accumulator` to point to a different value. This means the users of `reduce` has to understand that the `initial value` will not retain its state after the function is called.

## Solution Strategy

Each call to `reduce` comes with three arguments:
  - An iterable collection
  - A transformation function that works with and returns the data type of that collection
  - A initial-valued accumulator of the same data type

Our job is relatively simple given that setup:
- We loop through the collection, accessing and processing each element in isolation
- For each element, we invoke the transformation function with it and the accumulator as arguments
- We expect a value to be returned, which contains the new accumulation state, so we update the accumulator reference to point to the returned value
- Once all elements are processed, we return the reference of the accumulator value

## Implementation Details

The basic implementation structure is simple, especially in the context of a "rolling sum"
```dart
int reduce(
  List<int> nums,
  int Function(int accumulator, int item) combine,
  int initialValue,
) {
  int result = initialValue;
  for (var n in nums) {
    result = combine(result, item);
  }
  return result;
}
```

The challenge is in trying to make the function as generic as possible. First, we recognize that `combine` manages the logic of combining values internally. We don't have to deal with any of that complexities.

God knows what it means to add a string literal `"5"` to a floating point value of `10.2`, but that's not our business. Our business is merely to invoke `combine` and feeding into it the values `"5"` and `10.2`. So let's do that

```dart
T reduce<T>(
  List<T> items,
  T Function(T accumulator, T item) combine,
  T initialValue,
) {
  T result = initialValue;
  for (var item in items) {
    result = combine(result, item);
  }
  return result;
}
```

This looks a lot better, but it's still making a subtle assumption that isn't obvious at first glance:

> `List<T> items`

We are asserting that the list can only contain values of the same data type as the accumulator, but this is not strictly necessary because, once again, we are not dictating the logic of the combination process. For example, if we're counting occurences of Strings, then when we see a collection of Strings, we don't immediately assume the data we're interested in is of type String. Rather, we're interested in an integer.

So let's fix this unnecessary constraint. All the compatibility we need to explicitly handle is the data type between the `accumulator` and the return type of the `combine` function, as one gets assigned to the other's reference.

```dart
T reduce<T, E>(
  List<E> items,
  T Function(T accumulator, E item) combine,
  T initialValue,
) {
  T result = initialValue;
  for (var item in items) {
    result = combine(result, item);
  }
  return result;
}
```
