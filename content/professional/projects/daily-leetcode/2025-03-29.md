## Problem Statement

Given an integer N, write a program that returns, in order, the first N regular numbers.

A regular number is defined as one which evenly divides some power of 60, or equivalently, a number whose only prime divisors are 2, 3, and 5.

## Initial Analysis: The Compliance Approach

My first instinct was to verify compliance—to check each integer sequentially to determine if it's regular. This is straightforward:

```dart
bool isRegular(int n) {
  // Remove all factors of 2
  while (n % 2 == 0) n ~/= 2;
  
  // Remove all factors of 3
  while (n % 3 == 0) n ~/= 3;
  
  // Remove all factors of 5
  while (n % 5 == 0) n ~/= 5;
  
  // If n == 1, only 2, 3, and 5 were factors
  return n == 1;
}
```

While this correctly identifies regular numbers, generating the first N in order would require testing potentially many more than N numbers, then sorting the results. There must be a more direct approach.

## Exploring Number Generation

Since regular numbers are products of powers of 2, 3, and 5, we could try generating them using the formula:

$$2^i \times 3^j \times 5^k$$

Where i, j, and k are non-negative integers. However, this approach presents several challenges:

1. **Lack of clear progress indicator**: There's no straightforward mapping between the exponents (i,j,k) and the magnitude of the resulting number. For example, 3² = 9 is greater than 2³ = 8, despite using fewer exponents overall and would, as a result, be generated first. This makes it difficult to systematically generate regular numbers in ascending order.

2. **Termination complexity**: Even if we generate more numbers than needed and then sort them, we still need a reliable termination condition. How do we know we've generated enough numbers to confidently take the first N?

## Seeking an Ordered Approach

What we need is a method that generates regular numbers in strictly ascending order, so we always know exactly which number comes next. This would allow us to keep precise track of our progress and terminate exactly when we've found N numbers.

But this raises a critical question: How do we determine what the next smallest regular number is at each step?

## The Crucial Insight

The key insight comes from understanding that 1 is the base case for regular numbers. All regular numbers are built from other regular numbers because they are all built from 1 (when i=j=k=0).

This leads to an inductive approach:
- Given any regular number N, we can guarantee that our process produces the next smallest regular number N+1
- Base case: Given 1 as the first regular number, we assert that 2 is the next smallest regular number (as there exist no other numbers between 1 and 2)

This inductive framework allows us to build the sequence recursively: we can reliably produce the next smallest regular number because we trust that the values we're working with are themselves correctly ordered regular numbers.

The rest is simply logistical challenges in ensuring that we produce the smallest possible value given a list of existing normal numbers.

## Building the Next Smallest Number

Let's take a step back and think through what we're dealing with. Every regular number can be expressed as a product of another regular number and one of our prime factors (2, 3, or 5).

### The Observation

What's the smallest possible regular number we can build?

$minNext = 1 \times 2 = 2$

But after we've generated 2, what comes next? If we keep using 1 as our base, we'd get:

```
1 × 2 = 2  ✓ (Already added)
1 × 3 = 3  ← Next smallest
1 × 5 = 5  
```

After adding 3, our sequence becomes [1, 2, 3]. Now what?

```
1 × 2 = 2  ✓ 
1 × 3 = 3  ✓
1 × 5 = 5  ← Next smallest
2 × 2 = 4  ← Competing candidate
```

At every point, there are multiple competing normal numbers that, when combined with different prime factors, can potentially produce the next smallest normal number. In our simple exploration so far, the combination `1x5` is in competition with the combinations `2x2` and `3x2`.

### The Tracking Challenge

One approach might be to use a set of "used values" to track which products we've already considered. But this quickly becomes unwieldy:

```
For [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], we'd need to track:
1×2, 1×3, 1×5, 2×2, 2×3, 2×5, 3×2, 3×3, 3×5...
```

That's 3 potential products for each regular number we've found—leading to an inefficient O(3N²) runtime.

### The Insight: Three Parallel Progressions

Consider what happens if we organize our candidates by prime factor:

| Base × 2 | Base × 3 | Base × 5 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| 1 × 2 = 2 | 1 × 3 = 3 | 1 × 5 = 5 |
| 2 × 2 = 4 | 2 × 3 = 6 | 2 × 5 = 10 |
| 3 × 2 = 6 | 3 × 3 = 9 | 3 × 5 = 15 |
| 4 × 2 = 8 | 4 × 3 = 12 | 4 × 5 = 20 |

For each step, we choose the smallest value across all three columns.

The critical realization: we don't explore a regular number with all prime factors at once. If regular numbers `A < B`, it doesn't make sense to consider `B×2` before `A×3` if `A×3 < B×2`.

### Three Pointers

Rather than one progress indicator for which regular number we're at, we need three independent pointers—one for each prime factor progression. The smallest product among these three candidates becomes our next regular number.

## The Solution: A Three-Pointer Approach

The implementation leverages this insight using three pointers to track the next candidates:

```dart
List<int> getRegularNumbers(int n) {
  if (n <= 0) return [];
  
  List<int> result = List.filled(n, 0);
  result[0] = 1;  // First regular number is 1
  
  // Pointers to track which regular numbers to multiply by 2, 3, and 5
  int i2 = 0, i3 = 0, i5 = 0;
  
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    // Find next candidates by multiplying with 2, 3, and 5
    int next2 = result[i2] * 2;
    int next3 = result[i3] * 3;
    int next5 = result[i5] * 5;
    
    // Take the smallest candidate as the next regular number
    result[i] = min(next2, min(next3, next5));
    
    // Update pointers for all values that match the minimum
    // This handles cases where the same value can be reached multiple ways
    if (result[i] == next2) i2++;
    if (result[i] == next3) i3++;
    if (result[i] == next5) i5++;
  }
  
  return result;
}
```

The beauty of this approach is in how it manages "used" values. The three pointers ensure we don't consider pairs of factors we've used before, preventing duplicates while maintaining strict ordering.

## Handling Edge Cases

A critical detail in this implementation is how we handle potential duplicates. A regular number might be expressible in multiple ways—for example, 6 can be calculated as 2×3 or 3×2. By incrementing all pointers that match the minimum value, we ensure each regular number appears exactly once in our sequence.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(N) - we perform a constant amount of work for each of the N numbers we need to generate
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) - storing only the result array

## Final Thoughts

What I find most elegant about this solution is how it builds on the fundamental structure of regular numbers themselves. Rather than forcing an external ordering mechanism, we're simply following the inherent properties of these numbers, letting their mathematical nature guide our algorithm.

The three-pointer approach demonstrates a beautiful case of problem reduction: by leveraging what we already know (the regular numbers we've found so far), we can systematically discover what comes next, in perfect order.
